The highly experienced and trained technical team is always up to the helm to provide customized services, and it is highly unlikely to encounter a scenario for cancellation of a contract. The patrons are requested to review the company portfolio and be adequately informed before entering into any legal agreement.

The company, in accordance with its existing policy, would charge 50% of the payment as an advance to start the activity. There would not be a compromise on client expectations at any point, and the adequate number of revisions as required will be performed until the desired outcome is achieved. A provision to edit the initial draft based on the client feedback is allowed up to 3-5 times, to ensure customer satisfaction. The clients are encouraged to avail the adequate number of revisions as necessary. However, under no circumstance, the company would allow the cancellation of the agreement. An agreed contract CANNOT BE CANCELLED. The company thereby requests its potential customers to make themselves fully aware of guidelines prior to entering into an agreement.
