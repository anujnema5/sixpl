We have recently redesigned our website. This blog is still in progress. Please check back later for the complete version of this blog.

On-Page SEO refers to the changes we make on the website. The objective of these changes is to make sure that Google's bot reads and understands our pages in the way we want.

It has the following components:

- Keyword Research & Analysis  
- Title Tag
- Meta Description
- URL 
- Header tags
- Keyword density and spread
- Image alternative text
- Inbound/Outbound Links
- Content Quality
- Technical SEO

In the next few days, we will explain each of these points.

Check the blog soon for the latest update.
